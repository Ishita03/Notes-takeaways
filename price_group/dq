Convert the following checks into spark code and add part of pipeline, if any one of the following fails then throw the exception, log the reason and abort the job.
  -- Anchor should not associate with multiple group at point in time
select count(distinct group_n), group_anchor_id, channel_n from stg_priceent_wrk.price_group 
  where  group_deleted_f = false
  group by group_anchor_id, channel_n having count(distinct group_n) > 1

  -- Member should not associate with multiple Anchor at point in time
  select count(distinct group_anchor_id), members_tcin, channel_n from stg_priceent_wrk.price_group 
  where  group_deleted_f = false 
  group by members_tcin, channel_n having count(distinct group_n) > 1
  
-- Member should not associate with multiple groups at point in time
  select count(distinct group_n), members_tcin, channel_n from stg_priceent_wrk.price_group 
  where  group_deleted_f = false 
  group by members_tcin, channel_n having count(distinct group_n) > 1  



  Not sure the DataSpectrum support these checks otherwise add the spark code as shown below for each one
val memberInMultipleGroupCount = {
  finalDdDupDF.filter(col("group_deleted_f") === false && col("members_update_utc_ts").isNotNull)
    .groupBy("members_tcin", "channel_n")
    .agg(countDistinct("group_anchor_id").as("group_count"))
}

if (memberInMultipleGroupCount.count() > 0) {
  val alertMessage = memberInMultipleGroupCount
    .collect()
    .map(row => s"Value: ${row.getString(0)}, Group Count: ${row.getLong(1)}")
    .mkString("\n")

  // Log the alert message
  LogInfo(s"Alert: The following values are assigned to multiple groups:${memberInMultipleGroupCount.count}")

  // Abort the pipeline by throwing an exception
  throw new RuntimeException("Aborting pipeline due to values assigned to multiple groups.")
}
